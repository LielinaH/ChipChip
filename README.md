## Overview

This project involves analyzing data and developing a Streamlit dashboard to visualize key business metrics for the ChipChip social buying platform.

### About ChipChip: Our Social Buying Platform

ChipChip is a unique marketplace that connects sellers and customers by enabling users to make purchases either individually or as part of a group, enjoying discounted prices. Groups have a limited time (e.g., 24 hours, 48 hours..etc) to reach their member count goal (e.g., 5/5, 3/3). If the goal isnâ€™t met, the group is considered expired and refunds are processed. This mechanism encourages community engagement and savings through collective purchasing.

## Directory Structure

The directory structure for the project is as follows:


- [notebooks]: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and exploration.
- [streamlit_app]: Contains the Streamlit application code.
  - `app.py`: Main Streamlit application file.
  - `preprocessing/`: Contains preprocessing scripts.
    - `data_preprocessor.py`: Script for data preprocessing.
- [.gitignore]: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- [ChipChip_Report.pdf]: Project Report.
- [README.md]: Project documentation.
- [requirements.txt]: List of dependencies required for the project.
- [Struture.md]: Detailed structure of the database.


## Features

- **Dynamic Heatmap**: Visualize the correlation between product categories and order contributions across vendors.
- **Time-Series Forecast**: Forecast order trends using ARIMA and Prophet models.
- **Grouped Bar Chart**: Compare order quantities for group deals vs. individual deals.
- **Performance Metrics**: Compare performance metrics (e.g., revenue, conversion rates, user retention) for different product categories.
- **User Segmentation**: Segment users into different groups (e.g., high-value customers, occasional buyers) using K-Means clustering.
